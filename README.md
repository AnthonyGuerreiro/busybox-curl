# busybox-curl

`Busybox` based on `Buildroot 2014.11` container and rootfs builder for minimal Docker base images 
equipped with `curl-7.39.0` including SSL/TLS support.

For `Buildroot 2015.02` have a look at the [2015.02](https://github.com/odise/busybox-curl/tree/2015.02) branch.

The rootfs build can be found in the `tarmaker` directory. It is heavily 
inspired by radial/core-busyboxplus.
